Code exercise:

Write a program that parses a sentence and replaces each word with the following: first letter, number of distinct characters between first and last character, and last letter. 
Words are separated by spaces or non-alphabetic characters and these separators should be maintained in their original form and location in the answer. 

For example:

Input 1:                It was many and many a year ago
Output 1:            I0t w1s m2y a1d m2y a y2r a1o

Input 2:                Copyright,Microsoft:Corporation
